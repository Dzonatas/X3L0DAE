Pronounced: "cello day"

Link: [Goals](https://github.com/Dzonatas/X3L0DAE/wiki/GOALS)<br/>
Link: (Atomatrix)[http://atomatrix.sourceforge.net/], Jonathan Ballard.<br/>
Code: [URN:BIT#](URN:BIT#), gist:<976189>, rel=https://gist.github.com/.

Wrap github's wiki & front-end with jsLinux instead of PHP:

```
POST git:/TOKEN.JSON [https://gist.github.com/976189]
  {
  IPL: /jslinux.json?root=gh-pages,mount("localStorage","rw+C")=git:branch:TOKEN("JS++:",0x),page="cello day",...
  User-Agent: {"User": 0_; "Agent": 0x_;}.CSS

  [Program: /* C# ClientScript(@_)...(assembly) */]
  "OOPS..." (try simplier sign-on/sign-off implementations, "catch" @_..., @_..., @_...)

  "Strung#." (Accept: text/xml+json, application/posix+ECMA, static-entities/URN,IHAVE,SENDME, {LINQ:_}.)
  }.
```

"IHAVE/SENDME" is well-known in USENET transport protocols. I already implemented "->" code in Atomatrix.

```
POST /. _/#.#
Vary: _, IHAVE, #.#, SENDME.
Prefer: HTTP, SMTP, NNTP:Distribution:(.UUCP|.TLD|...), ...UDP.NET.

UDP -> JSON; {IHAVE:[_,.,.,.]; SENDME:[_,.,.,.];}.CSS.
CSS -> ihave, sendme; ...
...
```

We could target <code>data:</code> as the default device instead of localStorage while offline, with the above encoded into C=string format. The scripts for jsLinux could be stored in one UDP.NET(.exe) redistributable, and it could use "Application Data" instead of "localStorage." I wrote BIT representations in the wiki as unordered numeric regressions, and it is useful for money if you use your decimal values.

.dae/unicode.ascii: The complete file is impossible, so we want use sparse allocation for valid assets. The .dae directory lets us manipulate file.dae types by character techniques and profiles.
