Pronounced: "cello day"

Link: [Atomatrix](http://atomatrix.sourceforge.net/), Jonathan Ballard.<br/>
Code: [URN:BIT#](URN:BIT#), gist:<976189>, rel=https://gist.github.com/.
Code: ![{QR-CODE:}](http://www.google.com/chart?chs=150x150&cht=qr&chl=http://icesphere.googlecode.com/files/Icesphere-0.10.2.4-Windows-Setup.exe&chld=L|1&choe=UTF-8)

Wrap github's wiki & front-end with jsLinux instead of {PHP}: [https://github.com/github/gollum]

```
POST git:/TOKEN.JSON [HTTPS](http://github.com/http2) 
  {
  IPL: /jslinux.json?root=gh-pages,mount("localStorage","rw+C")=git:branch:TOKEN("JS++:",0x),page="cello day",...
  User-Agent: {"User": 0_; "Agent": 0x_;}.CSS

  [Program: /* C# ClientScript(@_)...(assembly) */]
  "OOPS..." (try simplier sign-on/sign-off implementations, "catch" @_..., @_..., @_...)

  "Strung#." (Accept: text/xml+json, application/posix+ECMA, static-entities/URN,IHAVE,SENDME, {LINQ:_}.)
  }.
```

"IHAVE/SENDME" is well-known in USENET transport protocols. I already implemented "->" code in Atomatrix.

```
POST /. _/#.#
Vary: _, IHAVE, #.#, SENDME.
Prefer: HTTP, SMTP, NNTP:Distribution:(.UUCP|.TLD|...), ...UDP.NET.

UDP -> JSON; {IHAVE:[_,.,.,.]; SENDME:[_,.,.,.];}.CSS.
CSS -> ihave, sendme; ...
...
```

We could target <code>data:</code> as the default device instead of localStorage while offline, with the above encoded into C=string format. The scripts for jsLinux could be stored in one UDP.NET(.exe) redistributable, and it could use "Application Data" instead of "localStorage." I wrote BIT representations in the wiki as unordered numeric regressions, and it is useful for money if you use your decimal values.

Scalar interface already implemented in code. ("[QR].Scalar")

.dae/unicode.ascii: The complete file is impossible, so we want use sparse allocation for valid assets. The .dae directory lets us manipulate file.dae types by character techniques and profiles.
